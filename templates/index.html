    <h1>Welcome to Pentagame</h1>
    <p>
      Pentagame is an abstract strategy game without chance element. It is
      played on a pentagram star that shows 100 round stops. The 5 corners and
      the 5 crossings in the pentagram are colored (white, blue, red, green,
      yellow). It can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players. It looks a bit like a
      pentagonal ludo, but it is truly different. For example, there is no
      chance and pieces don't get beaten. Instead, it is all about moving,
      swapping, about paths and about areas. Every player plays 5 pieces of one
      shape, e.g. cats against pawns or whatever â€¦
