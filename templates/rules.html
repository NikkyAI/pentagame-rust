    Pentagame is an abstract strategy game without chance element. It is played
    on a pentagram star that shows 100 round stops. The 5 corners and the 5
    crossings in the pentagram are colored (white, blue, red, green, yellow). It
    can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players. It looks a bit like a pentagonal ludo,
    but it is truly different. For example, there is no chance and pieces don't
    get beaten. Instead, it is all about moving, swapping, about paths and about
    areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every player plays 5 pieces of one shape, e.g. cats against pawns or
    whatever. Every player has one white, one blue, one red, one green and one
    yellow piece. All pieces start the race on the corners of their respective
    colors. The goal is to bring three of one's pieces from their corners to the
    crossing of matching color.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are five black blocks that are neutral pieces. At the beginning they
    are on the crossings in the center. There are five gray blocks that come
    into the game as pieces reach their goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    One can move in any direction on the star or the ring, as far as there is a
    free path. But one cannot jump. One can either (1) just move to an empty
    space, (2) beat a black block, taking its place and re-position it on
    another free stop somewhere, (3) swap two neighboring pieces, one of which
    must be one's own piece.
  </p>
  <p>As Ko-rule, immediate repetition of the same move is not allowed.</p>
  <p>
    A piece that reaches its destination crossing is removed from the board. A
    player thus moving a piece out successfully gains a gray block that she can
    position on any free stop. Such gray blocks are also neutral pieces, but
    when they get beaten, they are removed again rather than re-positioned.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game becomes very complex very soon. Nevertheless, a two player game
    takes often under 20 minutes, a 3-player maybe 45 minutes, a 4-player some
    90 minutes. That of course depends on how long players think, or are allowed
    to think.
