/*
Gamemoves:
    Gamemoves contain information about moves (due to name conflict often called actions) done by players
    To allow actions such as placing a stopper the figure ids are used as below:
        1-25: player figures (1-5: first player with lowest UserGame.id, 6-10, second player â€¦)
        26-36: 5 gray, 5 black stoppers
    Stoppers are 'moved' (~placed) by the player colliding with them.
    Black stoppers are then moved to a new position, where no other figure is present (validation done based on graph state)
    Gray stoppers are moved to [src.0, src.1, src.2, -1, -1, -1] to mark them as 'off board'

    When figure id == 42 -> umove: [player_figure, points, -1, -1, -1, -1]
    This is used to allow for point saving without extra column
    All other GameMoves will be removed at the end of the game
